# ðŸ‘‹, I'm Minyoung

I am interested in looking ino data and solving economic problems, and communicating/teaching those insights and methodologies!

## Projects
- Most recently, I led a project where we looked into whether we could predict failure of a bank, and how early we could predict it with a team of 7 women data scientists. You can find details [here](https://github.com/maggieroot39/ds4a-fall2021)

## Teaching
- I am teaching at a coding bootcamp (with mission to increase diversity, equity,
and inclusion in the tech industry) covering Python, Explatory Data Analysis with real business cases, Machine Learning, and Decision Science. 
 - I also taught a [PhD level (Computational) Econometrics](https://github.com/minyoungrho/Econometrics2) using Julia curriculum on Numerical Optimization, Maximum Likelihood, General-
ized Method of Moments, Bayesian Methods, Time Series, Panel Data, and Quantile Regression
